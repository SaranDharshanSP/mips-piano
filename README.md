#Mips Piano

This is a virtual piano written in MIPS assembly and using the bitmap display and keyboard additions in the MARS simulator. 
The MARS simulator is required for this piano to work.

##Bitmap Display Config:
   - Tools->Bitmap Display
   - Set "Unit width/height in pixels" to 16
   - Set "Display width" to 1024
   - Set "Display height" to 256
   - Set "Base Address for display" to static data
   - Click "Connect to MIPS" *after* the rest are set
##Bitmap use:
   - The program will initialize the piano image immediatly so you must 
     connect the display to mips before running the program.
   - Pressing a valid key will highlight the piano key that is being played.
##Keyboard Config:
   - Tools->Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator
   - Click "Connect to MIPS"
##Keyboard use:
   - Type a valid character and the piano will play the pitch associated with
     that character.
